To create an interactive app similar to Patatap that triggers vector animations or text along with sound effects when a key is pressed, using a Next.js app and potentially extending it to use a MIDI keyboard, you can follow these high-level steps. We'll cover the essentials including playing sounds, handling key presses (both from a computer and MIDI keyboard), and displaying animations or text.

### 1. Project Setup

Start by setting up a new Next.js project if you haven't already:

```bash
npx create-next-app your-project-name
cd your-project-name
```

### 2. Adding Necessary Libraries

You might need libraries for sound playback and vector graphics animations. Howler.js is excellent for sound, and you could use either Three.js or Paper.js for graphics depending on your preference. For MIDI access, the Web MIDI API will be your go-to.

```bash
npm install howler three  # or replace 'three' with 'paper-jsdom' if you prefer Paper.js
```

### 3. Create Sound and Animation Assets

- **Sound Effects**: Gather or create short sound clips you'd like to associate with key presses. Ensure they're in a web-friendly format (like mp3).
- **Vector Animations**: You can create vector animations or text effects using HTML5 Canvas via either Three.js or Paper.js. You might design simple shapes, text pop-ups, or elaborate animations.

### 4. Handle Keyboard and MIDI Events

- **Keyboard Events**: Use React's or Next.js's built-in event handling to trigger functions on keypress events. You will map each key to a specific sound and animation. 

  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleKeyPress = (e) => {
      const charCode = e.key.toLowerCase();
      // Trigger the respective sound and animation based on 'charCode'
    };

    window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
    };
  }, []);
  ```

- **MIDI Events**: To handle MIDI keyboard inputs, you'd listen to MIDI events via the Web MIDI API.

  ```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    navigator.requestMIDIAccess().then((access) => {
      const inputs = access.inputs.values();
      for (let input of inputs) {
        input.onmidimessage = getMIDIMessage;
      }
    });
  }, []);

  function getMIDIMessage(midiMessage) {
    let command = midiMessage.data[0];
    let note = midiMessage.data[1];
    // You can map 'note' to sounds and animations just like keyboard keys
  }
  ```

### 5. Play Sounds and Animations

- **Playing Sounds**: When a key or MIDI note event is registered, use Howler.js to play the corresponding sound.

  ```javascript
  import { Howl } from 'howler';

  const soundMap = {
    'a': new Howl({src: ['/path/to/soundA.mp3']}),
    // map other keys or notes
  };

  const playSound = (key) => {
    soundMap[key]?.play();
  };
  ```

- **Triggering Animations**: Use Three.js or Paper.js inside a React component to create and manipulate animations. The animations can be predefined and triggered or dynamically generated based on the key press.

  ```javascript
  // This is a very basic example. Actual implementation will vary based on the library and your choice of animations.
  const triggerAnimation = (key) => {
    // Implement animation logic based on 'key'
    // E.g., altering shapes, running animations, displaying text, etc.
  };
  ```

### 6. Optimizations and Considerations

- **Loading and Playback**: Preload your audio and possibly even "compile" your animations upfront to ensure smooth playback.
- **Responsive Design**: Consider the layout of your visuals on different screen sizes.
- **Enhancements**: The sky's the limitâ€”consider adding recording capabilities, sharing features, or even multiplayer support.

### 7. Testing and Debugging

- Thoroughly test keyboard and MIDI functionality across different devices and browsers.
- Debug using browser tools and possibly MIDI monitoring tools to ensure messages are captured accurately.

### Conclusion

This high-level overview provides a roadmap for creating an interactive experience similar to Patatap using Next.js. Given the wide variety of animation and sound manipulation possibilities, your project can be as simple or complex as you choose. The key is to start small, validate your ideas, and iteratively build more sophisticated features.
